          <h2>The Lesson For Startups in Paul Graham's Blunder</h2>
<p class="meta">01 Jan 2014</p>

<div class="post">
<p>By now anyone with even a remote interest in Paul Graham and Y-Combinator has likely read his response <a href="http://paulgraham.com/wids.html" target="_blank">What I Didn&#39;t Say</a> to the uproar created by the alleged misreporting of statements he made about female founders in an &quot;interview&quot; with <a href="http://theinformation.com">The Information</a>. </p>

<p>However, whether you believe Graham is sexist (the &quot;hardest problem in computer science&quot;, as someone on Twitter claimed) or a victim of sloppy or unethical reporting, there&#39;s a valuable lesson for startups in his response, namely, don&#39;t ever pretend you&#39;re not in an &quot;actual interview&quot;, or that you&#39;re not in a situation where something you do or say could reflect poorly on you or your business.  Graham naievely thinks because it wasn&#39;t an &quot;actual interview&quot; he didn&#39;t have to be clear or careful about what he said, but that&#39;s a very poor example to set for anyone who looks to him for business advice. There&#39;s never a lack of reporters or competitors who will take something you do or say in an unguarded moment and use it to destroy you or your business!</p>

<p>His lame excuse from &quot;What I Didn&#39;t Say&quot;...</p>

<blockquote cite="http://paulgraham.com/wids.html">
<p>You may have noticed something else about that transcript. It's practically incoherent. The reason is that this wasn't actually an interview. Eric was just collecting material for a profile of Jessica he was writing. But he recorded the conversation, and 
later decided to publish chunks of it stitched together as if it had been an interview.</p>

<p> If this had been an actual interview, I would have made more effort to make myself clear, as you have to in an interview. An 
interview is different from an ordinary conversation. In a conversation you stop explaining as soon as the other person's facial
expression shows they understand. In an interview, the audience is the eventual reader. You don't have that real-time feedback,
so you have to explain everything completely.</p>

<p>Also (as we've seen), if you talk about controversial topics, the audience for an interview will include people who for various
reasons want to misinterpret what you say, so you have to be careful not to leave them any room to, whereas in a conversation you
can assume good faith and speak as loosely as you would in everyday life</p>
