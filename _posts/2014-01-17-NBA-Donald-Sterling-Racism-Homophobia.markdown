With NBA commissioner Adam Silver today handing down the maximum possible punishment to L.A. Clipper owner Donald Sterling, it is clear the NBA has a zero-tolerance policy for racism. Unfortunately, the punishment also shows that the NBA takes homophobia a lot less seriously.

Let’s compare the alleged crimes and punishment of Donald Sterling with those of several NBA players who have made very public and discriminatory remarks about homosexuals. 

Donald Sterling made his very offensive remarks in the privacy of his own home. He was seemingly not aware that his remarks were being recorded. It is illegal to record a conversation in California without the consent of every party to the conversation. One can assume that Sterling did not consent to his remarks being recorded. As a punishment for airing his private thoughts in the privacy of his own home, he has been banned for life from the NBA, will likely be subject to a forced sale of his team (if the Board of Governors agrees) and will face a $2.5 million fine. 

In 2011, Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant made a gay slur during the course of a game and was fined $100,000. Indiana Pacers star Roy Hibbert was fined $75,000 in 2013 for making a gay slur. In 2011, Chicago Bulls star Joakim Noah was fined $50,000 for a gay slur. The list goes on…All of their remarks were made in public while they knew the public was watching and listening. The fines they were subjected to represent a mere fraction of their annual salary. Not only are these players allowed to continue to participate in the NBA, they are frequently featured in league promotions. 

How were Sterling’s remarks any more serious? Sure, he spoke at greater length, but he wasn’t aware that anyone was listening. Considering the types of remarks NBA players make about homosexuals in public, can you imagine what NBA players say in the privacy of their homes? 

While the punishment given to Sterling by Commissioner Silver received overwhelming support from players, coaches, owners and commentators, the punishment seems excessive compared to how the NBA has disciplined players for offensive remarks about homosexuality, which may be one way for Sterling to launch a successful appeal. Let's hope Silver, still in his first year as Commissioner, undertakes a review of how the NBA has historically failed to punish homophobic remarks by its star players.
