Who am I to criticize the leadership team at 37Signals/Basecamp but for the sake of a blog post I'm going to do it anyways. I love Basecamp's open source projects but wouldn't look to them for guidance about running a business any time soon.  

Back on February 5, 2014, <a href="http:37signals.com/">37Signals</a> rebranded to Basecamp, announcing it would be focussing exclusively on Basecamp while shutting down or selling off all of its other products. Jason Fried wrote

>Moving forward, we will be a one product company. That product will be Basecamp.
>Our entire company will rally around Basecamp. 

On the same day of the announcement, Jason Fried <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonfried/status/431185002831679488"> tweeted</a> his admiration for the German Mittlestand his admiration for the German Mittlestand,

>The Mittelstand, a tier of impeccably run small manufacturers that measure growth
>not in years but in centuries 

The Inc <a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/201402/leigh-buchanan/business-lessons-from-german-mittelstand.html"> article</a> linked to in Fried's tweet profiles how successful German businesses stick to their core business, with only a single product. While Basecamp's decision to rebrand and focus exclusively on Basecamp the product had probably been made long before this tweet, it's easy to see a connection between Fried's admiration for the German Mittlestand and the decision to focus exclusively on Basecamp.  In fact, the paring down of 37Signals focus to Basecamp began much earlier than this announcement. In December 2013, Fried <a href="http://signalvnoise.com/posts/3700-big-know-your-company-grows-up-and-moves-out"> announced</a> in a Tweet that a project started in June 2013<a href="https://knowyourcompany.com/">KnowYourCompany</a>had grown up and was ready to move out. It was now being run as a separate business by Claire Lew, although it interestingly kept Jason Fried's cover letter on the front page. 


Now Fried's either reconsidered or carved out an exception because Basecamp's launching a new product <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3742-introducing-the-distance-the-business-magazine-about-businesses-that-havent-gone-out-of-business">the distance</a>about companies that never go out of business, very inspired by the Mittlestand in New York.
