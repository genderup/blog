More and more lately I've been watching <a href="https://medium.com/code-adventures/farewell-node-js-4ba9e7f3e52b">influential developers</a> switch to Google's Go, such that I've now started learning it myself. Then today, I noticed that Mark Bates MetaCasts will now focus exclusively on Go (server side) and Angular (front end for Go applications). No more Ruby, no more Ember.  If I'm going to spend more time on learning Go, then it makes sense to me to go (no pun intended) with a "Google Stack" and focus on Angular as a front-end framework.  On a side note, the developers of Discourse chose Ember because it played nicely with Rails conventions. I wonder if, as Go becomes the C of the 21st century and as more and more developers experiment with it, they will start thinking like I am and that it makes sense to use Angular with Go.
